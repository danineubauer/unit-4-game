# Purpose
\
This is the fourth homework assignment in the UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp (Week four) with the purpose of learning to work with JQuery.\

In this assignment, I created a short game where the computer chooses a random number, displayed as "Count" and assigns the four crystals their own random numbers too. Each time a crystal is clicked, the random number which is assigned to them gets added into the user's count ("your count"). The goal of the game is for the user to reach the "Count" by adding the assigned random numbers of the crystals. If the user reaches the exact number, they win the game and can continue to play a new game. \

The game was created to practice coding in JQuery.
